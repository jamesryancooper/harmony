# .harmony: Start Here

Enable reliable agent execution that is deterministic enough to trust, observable enough to debug, and flexible enough to evolve.

## Prerequisites

{{PREREQUISITES or "None required"}}

## Boot Sequence

0. **If `AGENTS.md` is missing at repo root:** run `/init` (or `.harmony/scaffolding/runtime/_ops/scripts/init-project.sh`) first; add `--with-boot-files` if `BOOT.md` and `BOOTSTRAP.md` compatibility files are needed; add `--with-agent-platform-adapters` for opt-in adapter bootstrap config
1. **Read `scope.md`** → Know boundaries
2. **Read `conventions.md`** → Know style rules
3. **Scan `catalog.md`** → Know available operations
4. **Read `continuity/log.md`** → Know what's been done
5. **Read `continuity/tasks.json`** → Know current priorities and goal
6. **Begin** highest-priority unblocked task
7. **Before finishing:** Complete `assurance/practices/session-exit.md`, verify against `assurance/practices/complete.md`

## Visibility & Autonomy Rules

| Directory | Autonomy | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `ideation/scratchpad/` | **Human-led only** | Human-led zone (thinking, staging, archives) |

Subdirectories: `inbox/` (staging), `archive/` (deprecated).

**Human-led:** Access ONLY when human explicitly directs to specific files.

## When Stuck

- Check `continuity/tasks.json` for blocked items
- Check `cognition/runtime/context/lessons.md` for anti-patterns to avoid
- Check `cognition/runtime/context/decisions.md` for relevant past decisions
- Review parent harness for patterns
- Document blocker in `continuity/log.md` and stop
